# Apartments

A GUI application made in C++ in order to learn to use classes (understand the concepts of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstractism, virtualization, overloading and maybe other concepts i forgot to mention) and different libraries such as STL.

My first GUI application where I've used Observer Pattern and dynamic loading of elements in the list view.

I've done a quick transition from the C project to this one, because C++ is, as some people still say, C with classes.
